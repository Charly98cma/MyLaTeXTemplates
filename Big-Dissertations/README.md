# Big Dissertation Template

This template is made to be used for long dissertations, that will contain
images, a formal cover, bibliography, etc...

There are some fields that you must fill with your information, and, since
they're scattered along a couple of files, I will point them here:

- **include/student-info**: Here, you have to specify the dissertation
  information (such as title, authors, department, subject, etc...)
- **include/cover**: If you have your university and faculty logos, place them
  on the `Images` directory, and replace here both `Images` paths to match your
  images.
- **include/preambule**: Here, you'll write the metadata of the resulting pdf,
  by specifying the authors names, and the document title and subject.

When you've filled this information, the rest is writing your
dissertation/essay. Each section will have its own file, which you will include
on the main (`big-template.tex`, change the name if you want to) in the same way
the first section has been included.
